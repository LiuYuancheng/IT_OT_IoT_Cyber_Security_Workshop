Excited to share my experience from attending and supporting *Deutschlands Bester Hacker 2024* in Dortmund!

It was an honor to be part of this incredible cybersecurity event, where the brightest hacking minds come together to demonstrate their skills and passion. The atmosphere at BaseStack Dortmund was absolutely electrifying! âš¡ With a packed agenda of workshops, keynotes, and hands-on challenges, there was something for everyoneâ€”from beginners exploring HacktheBox and Juice-Shop-Hacking to the pros taking on advanced challenges from the Bundeswehr.

This year, the event placed a strong emphasis on discovering new talent and strengthening the white-hat hacking community. No qualification rounds were neededâ€”everyone had the opportunity to participate and grow. The unique blend of gaming, hacking, and networking made this event truly unforgettable.

A special highlight for us at NUS-NCL was supporting the IT-OT challenges focused on robotic arm control systems in smart manufacturing environments. We showcased how IT-based attacks can have serious consequences on operational technology (OT) systemsâ€”a crucial topic as cybersecurity in these environments becomes increasingly critical.

The day concluded with an exciting finale at Dortmunder U, featuring prize ceremonies and an after-party. ðŸŽ‰

Huge thanks to the *Deutschlands Bester Hacker* team for their hard work and great effort in organizing such a successful event! Looking forward to connecting with more like-minded professionals dedicated to making the digital world a safer place. See you all next year at *Deutschlands Bester Hacker 2025*!
