### Cyber Den Project

#### People Detection Radar [IoT] Raspberry PI Xandar Kardian IoT People Count Radar

**Program Design Purpose**: 

People detection sensors and radars are utilized in various applications across multiple fields such as security and surveillance, healthcare, building automation, smart cities, transportation and autonomous manufacturing systems. This project aims to develop a prototype  IoT device for an indoor people counting using the Xandar Kardian people detection radar and a Raspberry Pi. The device will be network-ready and easily integrated with other systems. The Python-based IoT firmware will run on the Raspberry Pi and provide the following functionalities:

1. Read raw data from the people detection radar to determine the number of people in an area.

2. Offer a web interface for users to view the data and adjust radar parameters.

3. Provide IoT data access authorization and interfaces for integration with other systems.

The IoT device program workflow is shown below :

The cyber Den box includes one Xandar Kardian Peopoe detection radara CT100: https://xkcorp.com/products/built-environment/ct100/ and one Raspberry PI. The hardware connection is shown below:

During the cyber exercise, the participants need to try to attack the IoT system to mess up the one or multiple radar reading data.
