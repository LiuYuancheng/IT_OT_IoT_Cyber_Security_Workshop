### Introduction

DeepSeek, a Chinese AI firm, is disrupting the industry with its low-cost, open source  large language models, challenging U.S. tech giants. It has shown high performance in mathematic, coding, English and Chinese Conversation. The DeepSeek-R1 model  is opensource ( MIT License ). This article explores the detailed steps to deploy the DeepSeek-R1:7B LLM model on a Windows laptop with an NVIDIA RTX 3060 (12GB GPU) to create a customized AI-powered chatbot or a program code generator using knowledge database Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and do a simple comparison between the normal LLM answer and RAG answer.

- For the AI customer service chatbot, we want it to provide information based on company product documentation, making it a powerful tool for internal knowledge management and customer support.
- For the code generator, we want it to assist in software development by generating code snippets based on existing program APIs or importing functions from a customized library.

To implement this project, we will use four key tools:

- **Ollama** : A lightweight, extensible framework for building and running language models on the local machine. [> link](https://ollama.com/)
- **DeepSeek-R1** : A model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning. [> link](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/tree/main)
- **nomic-embed-text** : An open-source text embedding model that converts text into numerical vectors, allowing computers to understand the semantic meaning of text by comparing its representation to others. [> link](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text)
- **AnythingLLM** : An open-source AI chatbot that allows users to chat with documents. It's designed to help businesses and organizations make their written documents more accessible. [> link](https://anythingllm.com/)

This approach significantly improves **AI-assisted decision-making, technical support, and software development** by ensuring that responses are **grounded in reliable, domain-specific information**.

### Background Knowledge 

#### DeepSeek-R1: A High-Performance Open-Source LLM

DeepSeek AI is pioneering a new era of reasoning-based large language models (LLMs) with its DeepSeek-R1 series, designed to push the boundaries of mathematical, coding, and logical reasoning capabilities. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), DeepSeek AI adopts a reinforcement learning (RL)-first approach, enabling models to naturally develop complex reasoning behaviors.

**Evolution of DeepSeek-R1 Models**

- DeepSeek-R1-Zero was the first-generation model trained purely through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), allowing it to self-verify, reflect, and generate long chain-of-thoughts (CoT) without SFT. However, it faced challenges such as language mixing, readability issues, and repetitive outputs.
- DeepSeek-R1 improved upon this by incorporating cold-start data before RL training, resulting in a more refined and human-aligned model with performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across various reasoning benchmarks.

#### Understanding Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-augmented generation is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with information from specific and relevant data sources. RAG enhances generative AI models by retrieving external data before generating responses, leading to more accurate, up-to-date, and context-aware answers. 

The work flow of RAS is shown below:

![](img/s_03.png)

- In the **Normal LLM Question-Answer Flow** , when a user asks a question. Thee LLM processes the input and generates an answer **only based on its pre-trained knowledge**. There is no external data retrieval, meaning outdated or missing information cannot be corrected.
- In the **LLM with RAG Question-Answer Flow**, when a user asks a questions. The The system first retrieves relevant information from external sources (databases, documents, APIs, or the web). The retrieved data is fed into the LLM along with the original question, then the LLM generates an answer based on both pre-trained knowledge and retrieved data, leading to more accurate and up-to-date responses.

### Step 1 : Deploy DeepSeek-R1 Model on Your Local Machine

To set up the **DeepSeek-R1** model locally, you first need to install Ollama, a lightweight, extensible framework for running large language models on your machine. Then, you will download the appropriate DeepSeek-R1 model based on your hardware specifications.

**1.1 Install Ollama**

Download **Ollama** from the official website: https://ollama.com/download, and select the installation package for your operating system:

![](img/s_04.png)

Once the installation is complete, verify that Ollama is properly installed by running the following command in a terminal:

```
ollama --version
```

If the version number shows, which means the Ollama is ready for use:

![](img/s_041.png)

Next, start the Ollama service by running:

```
ollama serve
```

**1.2 Choose the Right DeepSeek-R1 Model**

DeepSeek-R1 offers models ranging from a compact 1.5 billion-parameter version to a massive 671 billion-parameter model. The model size you choose should match your GPU memory (VRAM) and system resources. In Ollama web, select models then search deepseek as shown below:

![](img/s_05.png)

Below is a hardware requirement table to help you decide which model to deploy. If your hardware is below the recommended specs, you can still run a larger model by using hardware optimization tools like LMStudio (https://lmstudio.ai/), but this will increase processing time. DeepSeek-R1 Hardware Requirements : 

| Module Name      | Model Type Level | GPU VRAM                          | CPU                                                  | RAM         | Disk   |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| deepseek-r1:1.5b | Accessible       | No dedicated GPU or VRAM required | CPU no older than 10 years                           | 8 GB        | 1.1 GB |

- https://youtu.be/5RhPZgDoglE?si=xnHo9a9v7tvVd5sz

**1.3 Download and Run DeepSeek-R1**

For my local configuration, I use a 3060GPU(12GB), so I can try the 7b. We can use the `ollama pull to down load the model`  or just use the run command, if the module is not download, Ollama will auto download it:

```
ollama run deepseek-r1:7b
```

![](img/s_06.png)

Now, DeepSeek-R1 is successfully deployed on your local machine, and you can start asking AI questions directly from the terminal.

### Step 2 : Install nomic-embed-text

To build the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge base, we need nomic-embed-text, which converts data (such as PDF files or text strings) into vector representations. These vector embeddings allow the AI model to understand semantic relationships between different pieces of text, improving search and retrieval accuracy.

**2.1 Download nomic-embed-text**

Visit the official page: https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text and download the latest version as shown below:

![](img/s_07.png)

**2.2 Install via Ollama**

You can also install nomic-embed-text directly using the Ollama pull command:

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Once downloaded, **nomic-embed-text** is ready to be integrated into your RAG pipeline.



------

### Step3 : Install AnythingLLM and Deploy RAG

Go to the anythingLLM web download page  https://anythingllm.com/desktop to download the installer based on your system:

![](img/s_08.png)

Install and run the AnythingLLM, create a workshop named "DeepSeek-R1-RAG", then select the "open setting" icon of the workshop as shown below:

![](img/s_10.png)

Change the LLM configuration as shown below, select Ollama in the LLM Provider. Then select the deepseek-R1 in the Ollama Model, Max Tokens we set 4096 (you can set bigger if you need it to help analysis material or summerize a document), then select the save changes. 

![](img/s_11.png)

Then select the vector database and select the "LanceDB" which use 100% local vector DB runs on your local node as shown in below image:

![](img/s_12.png)

In the Embedder Tag, select the nomic-embed-text in the Ollama Embedding model then save the change : 

![](img/S_13.png)



### Step 4 : Load data and start test 

After finished the configuration now, we can start to load data and test. We prepare 4 PDF document for AI to use as knowledge base :

![](img/s_14.png)

The power grid simulation system introduction document and the user manual. 

The Cluster user action emulation (CUE) system introduction document and library API document. 

**4.1 Load the power grid data** 

In the workshop, create a "Power Grid Chat Bot" Thread, then select the upload icon as shown below:

![](img/s_15.png)

Then upload the 2 PDF file `PowerGrid_introduction.pdf` and `PowerGrid_UsageManual.pdf`, after upload finished, select both file and press "Move to Workspace" as shown below:

![](img/s_16.png)

Then select the "Save and Embed" as shown below, after the progress finished the LLM with RAG is ready for use. 

![](img/s_17.png)



**4.1 Test the DeepSeek-R1 ChatBot with Power Grid data RAG** 

Now we can try to ask DeepSeek-R1 a question related to the power grid simulation system and compare the result between with and without RAG.

Question: 

```
Give a short summary about the design of PLC and Remote Control Circuit Breaker Design in Power_Grid_OT_Simulation_System project. 
```

For DeepSeek-R1 without RAG it list a very general answer as shown below and don't have relationship with the Power_Grid_OT_Simulation_System:

![](img/s_18.png)

If we run the same question to the LLM with RAG,  the result is shown below, the answer introduce the power grid system and cover the HMI breaker control information. 

![](img/s_19.png)



**4.3 Load the Cluster User Action Emulator Project data** 

This time we remove the power grid doc and load the Cluster User Action Emulator Project introduction document CUE_Introduction.pdf and the python code API document Action_API_Doc.pdf as shown below:

![](img/s_20.png)



**4.4 Test the DeepSeek-R1 ChatBot with CUE data ** 

Now we can try to ask DeepSeek-R1 a question related to create a python script with the lib in cue

Question:

```
help create a python script/function uses the cluster user emulator(CUE) function API to ping an IP 192.168.10.100 and ssh login to the server with (username: admin, password: P@ssword)  to run a command "ifconfig" 
```

or DeepSeek-R1 without RAG, it doesn't understand what is CUE and use the requests lib with wrong answer:

![](img/s_21.png)

If we run the same question to the LLM with RAG,  the result is shown below, 

![](img/s_22.png)

As you can see the AI use the correct lib module provide in the API document and build the script
