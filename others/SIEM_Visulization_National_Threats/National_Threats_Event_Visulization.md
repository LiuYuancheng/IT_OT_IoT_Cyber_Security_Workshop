### Project Introduction

This project aims to develop a comprehensive dashboard plugin that visualizes large datasets of Singapore national cyber threat events, sourced from publicly available cybersecurity datasets. The dashboard is designed to offer real-time insights and an overview of cyber threats impacting various critical infrastructure sectors in Singapore. By leveraging data from trusted sources such as the Singapore Cyber Security Agency (CSA) Annual Cybersecurity Report and SingCERT (Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team) advisories, the dashboard provides a centralized view of national cyber threat activities. The key features includes:

- **Threat Event Summary**: Overview of total detected events within a specified period (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), with a timeline displaying event trends.
- **Top-N Threats and Actors**: Identification and ranking of the most frequent threats and threat actors, along with information on their types and methods.
- **Sector-Specific Analysis**: Categorization of threats based on critical infrastructure sectors (e.g., Government, Energy, Health), with breakdowns of how each sector is impacted.
- **Threat Actor Profiles**: Detailed information about known cybercriminal groups, APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats), and their typical behaviors, attack vectors, and patterns.
- **Event Timeline Visualization**: A graphical timeline showing the volume and frequency of cyber events, enabling the identification of spikes and anomalies over time.
- **Threat Type Distribution**: Pie charts or bar graphs illustrating the distribution of different types of threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware, malware) to help understand the prevalence of specific attack vectors.

The Singapore National Cyber Threat Dashboard Plugin is a vital tool for enhancing situational awareness of the cybersecurity landscape within Singaporeâ€™s critical infrastructure sectors. By offering a range of intuitive visualizations and real-time data, the dashboard aids in early threat detection, trend analysis, and informed decision-making. It bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insights, empowering researchers, security professionals, and policy makers to mitigate risks and improve national cybersecurity defenses.

#### Dashboard UI View 

The dashboard is designed with three main sections, providing a clear and intuitive way to visualize national cyber threat data. The dashboard view is shown below:

![](img/threatsDashboard.gif)

- **Total Threats Count Timeline**: This section displays a timeline chart showing the total number of detected threats, sorted by timestamp. Users can view data aggregated by day or hour, helping them track trends and spikes in cyber activity over time.
- **Top-N Threats Percentage Display**: This pane presents a summary of the most prevalent threats, categorized by threat name, actor, and affected sector. The display is configurable, allowing users to adjust the parameters based on their specific needs, such as viewing the top threats by name, key actors, or targeted sectors.
- **Sector-Specific Threat Line Charts**: This section offers line charts that categorize threat events by service type (e.g., Government, Energy, Health). Users can view trends sorted by day, which helps in identifying which sectors are most affected and how threat patterns vary across different actor service types.

The dashboard also provides interactive features: when a user clicks on data within the Top-N Threats pane or any sector panel, a detailed timeline dialog will pop up, offering an in-depth view of the selected threat information, as shown in the example image above. This functionality allows users to drill down into specific data points, enhancing their ability to analyze and respond to threats effectively.

#### Project Architecture

The project consists of two main components: the **Front-End Web Host** and the **Back-End Database Balancer**.

##### Front-End: Angular Web Host Program

- The front-end is built using Angular, providing an interactive web-based interface.
- It handles user HTTP(S) requests and delivers webpages for viewing and interacting with the dashboard.
- Users can customize and filter data views based on specific time periods, sectors, or threat types, making it easier to pinpoint relevant information.

##### Back-End: GraphQL Query Program

- The back-end is powered by a `GraphQL` query engine designed to optimize data fetching for multiple concurrent users.
- It efficiently manages requests by queuing and filtering based on user data permissions and access limitations, ensuring secure and scalable data retrieval.
- The system converts `GraphQL` queries into native database queries, pulling data from a database cluster to serve up-to-date, accurate information.

The dashboard is equipped with various data visualizations that summarize and categorize threats, allowing security professionals, researchers, and policy makers to identify trends, monitor real-time threat events, and enhance their understanding of Singapore's cybersecurity landscape.

### System/Program Design

The system consists of a **front-end web host program** developed using **Angular and TypeScript**, and a **back-end database balancer** programmed with **GraphQL and JavaScript**. The underlying data storage is managed by a **Druid cluster**, which handles large datasets effectively. the system diagram is shown below:

![](img/s_04.png)

As illustrated in the diagram, the system workflow involves several key components:

1. **Front-End Web Host**: The user interface facilitates interaction between security managers and the dashboard, allowing them to send requests and receive packaged data for visual analysis. The front-end handles user authorization, data requests, and displays key information through an intuitive graphical interface.
2. **Network Communication**: Requests from the front-end are processed and transmitted over a network, facilitating communication between the front-end and back-end systems.
3. **Back-End Database Balancer**: The back-end utilizes GraphQL to parse and optimize user queries. It manages authorization, ensuring data access permissions are verified before any data retrieval. It converts GraphQL queries to native database queries, filters results, and fetches data efficiently from the Druid database cluster.
4. **Data Source Integration**: The system integrates with various data sources, including the **CSA Annual Cybersecurity Report**, **SingCERT Advisories**, and **Asia Pacific (APAC) Cyber Information Sharing**, providing a comprehensive view of current cyber threats.
5. **Data Combination and Processing**: After retrieving data from the Druid cluster, the system combines and processes this information, packaging it into a format suitable for visualization on the dashboard.

This architecture ensures a smooth flow of data from multiple sources to a centralized dashboard, empowering users with critical insights and timely information to detect and mitigate cyber threats.
