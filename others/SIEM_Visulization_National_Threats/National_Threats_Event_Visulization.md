### Dashboard for Summarizing SG National Cyber Threads in Critical Infrastructure

**Program Design Purpose**: 

The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive plugin dashboard for a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, focusing on the effective monitoring, categorization, summarization, and visualization of cyber threat events targeting Singapore's critical infrastructure. This dashboard will provide researchers and security managers with a clear, concise view of national cybersecurity threats, enabling them to quickly detect and respond to potential cybercriminal activities and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) within a short timeframe (1 month).

Key features include visual representations of total event counts over time, identification of top-N threats, actors, and affected sectors, as well as categorization of threat actors across eight critical service sectors: Government Service, InfoComm, Manufacturing-Related Service, Energy Service, Transportation Service, Health and Social Services, Security and Emergency Services, and Banking and Finance Service. This tool will facilitate a better understanding of cybersecurity threats and help prioritize mitigation strategies across different sectors.







In a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, effective monitoring, categorize, summarize  and visualization of cyber threads events is crucial to detecting and responding to cyberattacks. 

We want to create a web based plugin dashboard to visualize the Singapore national cyber security threats events detection result in a short time period (1month) for researcher or security managers can understand the potential cyber Cybercriminals and APT detection .  We want to show the total events count timeline, top-N threats name, actors and sectors percentage and we will also categorized the threats actors time line chart under eight kinds of service types: `Government service` , `InfoComm`, `Manufacturing relate service`, `Energy service`, `Transportation service`, `Health social services`, `Security and emergency service`, `Banking and finance service`.
