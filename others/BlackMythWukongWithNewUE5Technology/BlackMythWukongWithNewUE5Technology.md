# New Ureal Engine 5 and Nvidia Technology used in game [Black Myth: Wukong]

In this article we want to share the what we learn the new Ureal Engine 4 and Nvidia GPU technology which used in the popular 3A computer game Black Myth: Wukong to improve the Game graphics quality. We use the Interview article of Game Science Interactive Technology, the Geekerwan's experiment and the Nvidia GTX40xx office Black Myth: Wukong introduction as reference. As I am not a game development expert, our view may from the point of a "software engineer" and if there is any mistake, many thanks if you can point out and give some comment. The technical we share will includes 5 parts, we will use the game's picture to show how the technology improve the Game graphics quality.

### Unreal engine 5 Niagara particle system 

The Niagara particle system in Unreal Engine 5 is a powerful and flexible tool for creating real-time visual effects, ranging from simple particles like smoke and fire to complex simulations such as fluid dynamics and advanced environmental effects. It is the successor to the older Cascade particle system, offering more control, scalability, and performance.

- **Node-Based Workflow**: Niagara uses a node-based interface, allowing artists and developers to build complex effects visually without deep programming knowledge. This workflow is intuitive and modular, making it easier to create and modify effects.
- **Customizable Emitters and Particles**: Niagara allows for a high degree of customization, enabling users to control various properties of particles, such as their shape, size, velocity, color, and lifetime. You can create emitters that spawn particles under specific conditions or in response to gameplay events.
- **Data-Driven Simulations**: Niagara supports data-driven simulations, meaning you can use data from various sources, such as physics simulations or external data files, to drive the behavior of particles. This allows for the creation of realistic and dynamic effects.
